SHORT DESCRIPTION
    cWaitForTcpPort is a Desired Configuration State (DSC) resource which is
    used to wait for a TCP port to become available.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The cWaitForTcpPort DSC resource can be used to halt the processing of a
    DSC configuration until a process on another host has completed.

    For example, it could be used to wait for a web server or MS SQL database
    server to become available.
    
    The initial implementation of this DSC resource was to wait for Active
    Directory setup to complete. By default, the MSFT_xWaitForADDomain resource
    has to be run on a machine with the Active Directory Remote Server
    Administration Tools (RSAT) installed. This resource can be run on a domain
    member - without RSAT - and can be configured to wait until the AD domain
    LDAP port 389 becomes available. This is great for member server deployment
    in a lab build!

EXAMPLES

    Configuration cWaitForLDAPDomainExample {

        Import-DscResource -ModuleName cWaitForTcpPort
    
        cWaitForTcpPort WaitForMyExampleDomain {
            Hostname = 'myFQDNdomain.local'
            Port = 389
            RetryIntervalSec = 30
            RetryCount = 10
        }
    }
